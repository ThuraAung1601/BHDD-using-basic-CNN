## BHDD Phase 1 - Basic ConvNet architecture

### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a model that will be able to recognize and determine the handwritten digits from its image by using the concepts of Convolution Neural Network and BHDD dataset. Though the goal is to create a model which can recognize the handwritten digits, it can be extended to letters and an individualâ€™s handwriting. The major goal of the proposed system is understanding Convolutional Neural Network, and applying it to the Burmese handwritten recognition system.

### Install requirements
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
tra@thura-pc:~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train BHDD with Basic ConvNet Architecture with Dropout
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}

### Run and deploy using Streamlit 
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
tra@thura-pc:~$ streamlit run app.py
```
### Experiments 
- We tried Single-layer Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron and ConvNet.
- The best result - 0.98 F-score of classification is by using ConvNet with Regularization (Dropout). Future works still need to be done for architectural innovation on BHDD.
